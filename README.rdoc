--- As asked by Grant ---
- The sort on the task template needs sorting as it won't sort logically, even by grabbing and moving - it does not seem to retain the new position even if I adjust the sort number;
- In "Type" we need to add Travel (Hrs), Transport (Â£), Mileage rate - plus a calculation if possible by multiplying miles by a set rate of say 45p per mile;
- Add a date for notes and sort descending from most recent using date so data can be entered in retrospect;
- Can the financials total time & cost by job;
- I need to be able to enter costs for travel time, Disbursements such as travel, mileage, Parking and add new;
- Tasks need to be removed from overview list once they have been completed (as discussed)
- Default tasks to short list (in job view)
- Update note types: Travel -> Travel (time), Transport -> Transport (cost)
- Jobs need a "status" - closed, archived, enquiry, active
- Jobs need a "start date" - refresh (incomplete) tasks from this date when changed
- Add 3 "observers" based on mediators for job (maybe use links table)
- Time stamp Notes and order by day & time
- Option to change task date completion, on hold or edit facility
- Mediation Fee & Admin Fee in Type
- Add facility to Types, Need additional Ground visit
  >> Add type: Invoice / sent / paid
  >> T&C
  >> Request for Change (RFC)
