TODO stuff

- The sort on the task template needs sorting as it won't sort logically, even by grabbing and moving - it does not seem to retain the new position even if I adjust the sort number;
- In "Type" we need to add Travel (Hrs), Transport (Â£), Mileage rate - plus a calculation if possible by multiplying miles by a set rate of say 45p per mile;
- Add a date for notes and sort descending from most recent using date so data can be entered in retrospect;
- Can we list / search jobs by job reference as options;
- Can the financials total time & cost by job;
- I need to be able to enter costs for travel time, Disbursements such as travel, mileage, Parking and add new;
- Tasks need to be removed from overview list once they have been completed (as discussed)
