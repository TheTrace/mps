TODO stuff

- Show the color pallet for color box
- Need a links table for > 1 party in A or B
- Show up to 2 weeks jobs as default in jobs#index
- Add mediation date/time UI widget to job mediation date
- Probably don't need "tentative_due_date" as well as "due_date" for tasks - sort out the logic

- Restructure jobs to have
-- Potential mediators, lawyers, etc
- Specified colours
- Ability to sort rows (task templates)
- Add ability to search contact from job form (added "add" buttons)
--- As asked by Grant ---
- The sort on the task template needs sorting as it won't sort logically, even by grabbing and moving - it does not seem to retain the new position even if I adjust the sort number;
- In "Type" we need to add Travel (Hrs), Transport (Â£), Mileage rate - plus a calculation if possible by multiplying miles by a set rate of say 45p per mile;
- Add a date for notes and sort descending from most recent using date so data can be entered in retrospect;
- Can the financials total time & cost by job;
- I need to be able to enter costs for travel time, Disbursements such as travel, mileage, Parking and add new;
- Tasks need to be removed from overview list once they have been completed (as discussed)
- Default tasks to short list (in job view)
- Update note types: Travel -> Travel (time), Transport -> Transport (cost)
- Jobs need a "status" - closed, archived, enquiry, active
- Jobs need a "start date" - refresh (incomplete) tasks from this date when changed
- Add 3 "observers" based on mediators for job (maybe use links table)
